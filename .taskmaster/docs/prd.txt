YouTube Keyword Bot v7 File Integrity Check and Repair Project

OVERVIEW:
Comprehensive review and repair of YouTube Keyword Bot v7 project files. The project previously had corrupted files (specifically keyword_expander.py) and needs a full integrity check to identify and fix any other corrupted or incomplete files.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Check all Python files for corruption or incomplete code
2. Verify file structure matches development plan requirements
3. Fix corrupted files using backups or recreation
4. Ensure all dependencies and configurations are correct
5. Validate the project is ready for deployment

REQUIREMENTS:

File Integrity Checks:
- Check main.py for complete Discord bot implementation
- Verify config.py has all required settings
- Check all core modules (keyword_expander, trend_analyzer, competitor_analyzer, prediction_engine)
- Verify all service modules (youtube_service, trends_service, gemini_service)
- Check all utility modules (cache_manager, progress_tracker, api_manager)
- Validate all __init__.py files

Corruption Detection:
- Identify files that start mid-function or mid-class
- Find files with syntax errors or incomplete implementations
- Detect missing imports or undefined references
- Check for truncated files or sudden endings

Repair Actions:
- Use backup files from backup_old_files folder when available
- Recreate missing or severely corrupted files based on development plan
- Fix import statements and dependencies
- Ensure all classes and functions are complete

Validation:
- Verify all required files exist per development plan
- Check requirements.txt has all necessary dependencies
- Validate configuration files (.env.example, railway.json, etc.)
- Ensure deployment files are properly configured

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All Python files are syntactically correct and complete
- No files have corruption indicators (mid-function starts, truncation)
- All required modules per development plan are present
- Project structure matches the planned architecture
- Ready for testing and deployment
